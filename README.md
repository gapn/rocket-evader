## How to Play

Your mission is to pilot the rocket and survive for as long as possible! Obstacles will continuously spawn from the top of the screen and fall downwards. Use your reflexes to dodge them. The longer you survive, the higher your score, and the faster the game gets! The game is over when you collide with an obstacle, but you can always restart to beat your score.
